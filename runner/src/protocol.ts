/**
 * NDJSON protocol between the gateway and the runner container.
 *
 * One JSON object per line on the container's stdout (runner→gateway); the
 * runner's own logs go to stderr only.
 *
 * This file is one of TWO byte-identical copies — src/runner/protocol.ts
 * (gateway side) and runner/src/protocol.ts (container side). The runner cannot
 * import from the gateway package at container build time, so the contract is
 * duplicated rather than shared. These two files are the only contract between
 * the two processes.
 *
 * When you add or change a message type, edit BOTH copies in the same change and
 * verify they still match:
 *     diff src/runner/protocol.ts runner/src/protocol.ts   # must print nothing
